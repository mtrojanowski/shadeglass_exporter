# Shadeglass Exporter

Scripts that allow exporting tournament data from shadedglass to CSV. This is primarly used to export data into the format required by the Warhammer Underworlds stats project. See the stats project here: https://underworlds-stats.vercel.app/main/dashboard

If you want to run the scripts, or want to know more, contact me via discord: @trojan3911
